# Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis in R

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of R for text mining and sentiment analysis, focusing on extracting insights and sentiments from tweet datasets. The project covers data cleaning, visualization, and sentiment scoring using popular R libraries.


## Analysis
- **Data Import and Cleaning:** Loaded and cleaned tweet data to create a unified data frame for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Implemented sentiment scoring using the `tidytext` library.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualized results with `ggplot2` to identify sentiment trends and insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- R Programming Language
- Libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidytext`, `stringr`,`lubridate`, `sentimentr`, `lexicon`, `afinn`
- Dataset: A tweet dataset (e.g., `cs_data2.csv`)

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with text mining techniques.
- Understanding of sentiment analysis workflows in R.
- Improved proficiency in data visualization and storytelling through graphs.
